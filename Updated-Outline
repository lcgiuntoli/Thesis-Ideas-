What we’ve done: 
Broke down authors cited in the scholia by time period and genre 
Looked at the particular functions of ἱστορία scholia 
Examined the earliest authors to see under what circumstances they were cited 
Planned a way to analyze the literary and grammatical contents of the scholia compared to Apollodorus and Hyginus 

Winter Break: Collect data on ἱστορία scholia 
What sections of the Iliad have ἱστορία scholia
Who appears in which stories
What does the function of each scholion seem to be 
How do the overall stories and language compare with Apollodorus’ and Hyginus’ accounts
Which authors are specifically cited  
Which geographic areas are mentioned 

Once school resumes
Communicate with MANTO to share ideas on the best way to analyze the scholia’s mythology, possibly get access to their Apollodorus data 
Construct visual representations of how mythological characters, authors, and places relate to one another 
Examine unique features of the scholia’s “Mythological world” as compared to those of Apollodorus and Hyginus
Hypothesize why some parts of myth are highlighted for explaining specific features of the Iliad 
Examine which authors are linked to which kinds of scholia
If we come across something that does not appear in Apollodorus or Hyginus, are we able to trace it back to its source? And if so, do we know why neither Apollodorus or Hyginus include it? 
What are the most common functions of ἱστορία scholia? Which parts of the text are they usually explaining? (i.e. epithets, genealogies, alluded to stories, etc.)
