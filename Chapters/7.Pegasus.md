The scholion on 6.183 is fascinating in the sense that, rather than justifying the content of the text, it instead simply states that Pegasus (a staple of the Bellerophon story in other accounts) is not present. The line is marked with a critical sign ὅτι to indicate that it will provide some sort of explanation, yet there does not seem to be one. The scribe seems to predict that the reader will find Pegasus' absence odd and makes note of it.
