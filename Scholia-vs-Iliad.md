When I began this project, I hypothesized that the mythological world of the scholia would match up as closely as possible with the mythological world of the Iliad text as part of the scribe's task to prove the veracity of Homer. However, certain scholia such as those regarding Sarpedon and Pegasus contradict this theory by seemingly contradicting the text. For example, Sarpedon in the Iliad is described as the king of Lycia and the son of Laodamia, the scholiast instead gives a backstory citing him as Cretan and the son of Europa. Although the Pegasus scholion does not directly say that the creature belongs in the scholion, its presence indicates that it is strange that the horse has no presence in the Iliad. This indicates to me that, in a sense, the scholiast would be undertaking an impossible task by attempting to create a definite version of mythology. Since these stories by their very nature do not have asingle correct version, it is inevitable that versions present in the scholia will differ from the Iliadic tradition.
