The comparison of Zeus’ plan for the Trojan War between Apollodorus’ Βιβλιοθήκη and the scholia reveals the different intent of the writers towards explaining the cause for the war. Apollodorus states that Zeus simply either wanted his daughter Helen to become famous throughout Europe and Asia, or for the race of demigods as a whole to be glorified through such an immense conflict. The scholiast, however, recounts a story from Stasinus stating that Gaea was burdened with the sheer overwhelming weight of humanity and requested that Zeus lighten her load by killing off a substantial number of people. This focus on death likely stems from the scholiasts’ goal to make sense of the Iliad text, where Διὸς δ᾽ ἐτελείετο βουλή is preceded by the idea of mighty heroes being sent to Hades and their corpses eaten by dogs and vultures. Apollodorus’ goal, on the other hand, is to make sense of the Trojan War throughout the overall corpus of mythology, and seeing its place as a sort of climax of his work, it seems logical that he would focus more on its overall fame rather than the destruction it wrought.
