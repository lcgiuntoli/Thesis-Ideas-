The purpose of our research is to examine the stories, characters, and authors preserved in the scholia of Iliad manuscripts. The scholia that are most important for this research are those containing variants of the words ἱστορέω and ἱστορία, as these appear when the scholiast wishes to provide a backstory concerning the text. We are interested in how the authors cited in these chronologically relate to the Homeric scholar Aristarchus. It appears that the pre-Aristarchan authors come from a variety of backgrounds while those who come after seem to chiefly be attached to mythology, particularly concerning the Trojan War. While ἱστορία scholia appear throughout the entire text, a significant number appear in Books I and II to provide context for the overall story. However, we have not found any detailing what happens after the story concludes. This reinforces that the scholia’s chief function is to help the reader understand the Iliad itself, with anything that occurs after being the responsibility of a separate work to cover.
