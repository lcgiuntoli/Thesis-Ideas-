The purpose of our research is to examine the “Mythological World of the Scholia;” that is, the stories, characters, and authors that are preserved in the scholia of Iliad manuscripts. The scholia that are most important for this research are those featuring variants of either the verb ἱστορέω or the noun ἱστορία, with these words typically appearing when the scholiast wishes to provide a backstory for a part of the text that apparently requires further elaboration. We are very interested in the authors cited in these scholia and how they chronologically relate to the Homeric scholar Aristarchus. So far, it appears that the pre-Aristarchan authors come from a variety of backgrounds, including poets, historians, and grammarians, while those who come after Aristarchus seem to chiefly be attached to mythology, especially that of the Trojan War. We are also curious in where these scholia are clustered within the Iliad; while they appear throughout the entire text, as one might expect a particularly large number appear in Books I and II to provide background on the story. While events that occur prior to the Iliad are described in these scholia, we have not found any detailing what happens after the story concludes. This reinforces the notion that the scholia’s chief function is to help the reader understand the Iliad itself, with anything that occurs after being the responsibility of a separate work to cover.
