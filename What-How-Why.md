When we refer to “The Mythological World of the Scholia,” we refer to the scholia that tell a backstory expanding on ideas presented in the Iliad text. We have identified these scholia by searching for variants of the noun ἱστορία and the verb ἱστορέω, both of which indicate that background is being provided for something mentioned in the text. My strategy has been to go through the scholia including these terms and first identify what story is being told, then seeing if it appears in the mythological handbooks of Apollodorus and Hyginus. The differences observed in the scholia backstories compared to more “standard” mythological versions will give us an idea of how mythology was viewed in a scholarly context as opposed to general storytelling. In this case, the stories chosen by the scholiast are meant to help a reader make sense of the Homeric text when it may not be entirely clear. Dionysius specifically identifies the idea of ἱστορία as a concern to scholars, demonstrating how important it was in the ancient understanding of literary criticism. By examining the sources used by scholars that no longer survive, we can reconstruct what sources some of these lesser known myths appeared in and paint a fuller tapestry of Greek mythology.
