1. ἱστορία, ἱστορέω are technical terms in D.T. *and* in the scholia.
2. Question:  what is the "mythological world" of the scholia? What needs explaining and why?


Discuss process (What-How-Why) 

Go into example (Tydeus' backstory) and examine what it's explaining from the text 

Demonstrate how scholia tradition can differ from Apollodorus (Zeus' plan) 

Show that sources other than mythology are cited (Aristotle's bird scholion)
