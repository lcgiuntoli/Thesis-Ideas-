1. ἱστορία, ἱστορέω are technical terms in D.T. *and* in the scholia.
2. Question:  what is the "mythological world" of the scholia? What needs explaining and why?
3. Process: what figures appear in ἱστ scholia?  What sources are cited?
4. Sources: overwhelmingly lit. works or works on mythology
    - Chronology: literary works *before* Aristarchus 
5. Mythological figures? Is it possible to generalize? (Characters outside *Iliad*?)


Discuss process (What-How-Why) 

Go into example (Tydeus' backstory) and examine what it's explaining from the text 

Demonstrate how scholia tradition can differ from Apollodorus (Zeus' plan) 

Show that sources other than mythology are cited (Aristotle's bird scholion)
