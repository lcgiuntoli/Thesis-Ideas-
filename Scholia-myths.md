It is interesting to note that some stories appear only in the scholia and not in the mythological handbooks of Apollodorus or Hyginus. Among these are Zeus' planning of the Trojan War, alternate names for Briseis, the binding of Zeus, names for the sons of Helen and Menelaus, and an episode recounting Achilles' sack of the city of Pedasus. One theory I may offer is that these many of these details are rather minute and may have seemed insignifcant for a general overview of myths. Often, these scholia are meant to explain details of the Iliad, a poem covering a section of just one period of the vast collection of Greek mythology. At other points, a topic will appear in a handbook but with a slightly different account: for example, Apollodorus agrees with the scholiast that Zeus planned the Trojan War, but for the sake of glorifying his lineage rather than alleviating the burden of humanity on Gaea. I am curious about the possibility that the sources the scholiast used for these notes were not consulted by Apollodorus or Hyginus for their retellings (these being Stasinus, Didymus, Demetrius, Porphyry). 

In one other interesting example, the scholiast notes an absence in the text that is present in other mythic retellings, that being the role of Pegasus in the story of Bellerophon.
