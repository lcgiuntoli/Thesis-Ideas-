My tutorial with Professor Smith will build a foundation for a thesis that will focus on the “Mythological World of the Scholia;” that is, the stories, characters, and authors that are preserved in the scholia of Iliad manuscripts. The scholia that are most important for this research are those featuring variants of either the verb ἱστορέω or the noun ἱστορία. These words typically appear when the scholiast wishes to provide a backstory for a part of the text that apparently requires further elaboration. Some examples include explaining an ambiguous epithet, giving further details on a story that is only briefly alluded to, or even correcting the actual poem at times with a different account of a particular myth. We hope to compare the stories that appear in the scholia with those in Apollodorus’ Βιβλιοθήκη to see how similar the general vocabulary and grammar are to one another. The distinctions that arise will hopefully give us better insight into the different methods for recounting myths between a mythological handbook and a scholarly companion to an established work. We also plan on using Professor Smith’s experience with topic modeling to create a visual representation of how different characters and cited authors relate to one another. We hope to add a further geographic component to this process by reaching out to and sharing ideas with the MANTO project, which has already done extensive work linking characters to geographic locations and includes researchers who are interested in scholia. Lastly, examining the chronology of the authors cited in the scholia will improve our understanding for which time periods and genres are most likely to contain backstories useful for the text of the Iliad.
