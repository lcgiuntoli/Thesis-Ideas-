Focusing mostly on authors:

Who is cited in ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia? 

Do certain authors tend to appear in scholia for a specific purpose? 

Are certain authors cited for specific kinds of backstories (such as those not directly linked to the Iliad?) 

Do authors associated with ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia also appear in other scholia, and if so how different are the contents of those scholia? 

Are authors from similar chronological periods cited for scholia covering similar content? 

How different are the scholia from authors before Aristarchus compared to those after him? 

How often are multiple authors cited in the same scholion? 

Which author is cited most often? 

Which chronological period of authors is cited most often in these scholia? 

Once we look into these questions, we could return to topic modeling and visualize which authors directly connect with one another, and perhaps separate them into different zones for specific scholia purposes (explaining certain words, elaborating on stories, correcting or giving variants to a story in the text, etc). Using this information, we could determine which author(s) had the most significant impact on ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia, as well as what these scholia are most often used for. 

Focusing mostly on characters: 

Which characters tend to appear in ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia? 

When do characters that do not feature heavily in the text appear in these scholia? 

Can we break characters into sections (i.e. appear in Iliad, don’t appear in Iliad but still linked to Epic Cycle, not linked to Iliad or Epic Cycle) and see if any of these sections are particularly influential in any of the scholia categories? 

What characters appear together in these scholia? 

Are certain characters specifically mentioned in certain types of scholia? 

Which characters appear most often (who has the most scholia backstory)? 

How much does the information provided for the characters in the scholia contradict the main text (Sarpedon’s backstory)? 

After exploring these questions, we can get a better idea of whether the backstories for characters in the scholia is typically meant to elaborate on what is provided in the text or to provide new stories not strongly linked to the Iliad itself. Topic modeling can let us see how often different categories of characters appear and when/if they interact with each other. We can also see how often these scholia actually contradict the text regarding the backstories of certain characters. 

Focusing on the actual stories: 

How similar are the stories in these scholia to the mythological works of Apollodorus and Hyginus? 

Which authors do Apollodorus and Hyginus cite, and how often do these overlap with the scholia?

Are the genealogies of characters consistent throughout these sources? 

Which characters appear in all of these sources? 

How similar/different are Apollodorus and Hyginus’ accounts to different chronological categories of authors? 

Which specific stories are retold in the scholia that appear in Apollodorus and Hyginus?

Which, if any, stories appear in scholia but do not appear in Apollodorus and Hyginus? 

This method will compare the mythological content of these scholia with the works of two well-known mythographers: Apollodorus and Hyginus. While these two authors set out mainly to compile as much mythological content as possible, the scholia are supposedly retelling stories that will aid in the reader’s understanding of the Iliad. I hope that, by contrasting the scholia contents with Apollodorus and Hyginus’, I will be able to gain a better understanding of the unique mythological world of the scholia and understand its function in relation to the text of the Iliad.
