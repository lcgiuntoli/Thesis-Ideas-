When we refer to “The Mythological World of the Scholia,” we refer to the scholia that tell a backstory expanding on ideas presented in the Iliad text. We have identified these scholia by searching for variants of the noun ἱστορία and the verb ἱστορέω, both of which indicate that background is being provided for something mentioned in the text. My strategy has been to go through the scholia including these terms and first identify what story is being told, then seeing if it appears in the mythological handbooks of Apollodorus and Hyginus. The differences observed in the scholia backstories compared to more “standard” mythological versions will give us an idea of how mythology was viewed in a scholarly context as opposed to general storytelling.
