Although ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia appear throughout the entirety of the Iliad, they are most heavily clustered together in Books I and II. This seems to make sense from a narrative level: the story begins fairly in media res and the scribe must have thought some general backstory on the plot and characters would be helpful. However, these scholia less frequently as the story progresses, indicating either less of a need to elaborate on backstories or perhaps simple scribal fatigue. While the scholia at the beginning of the epic indicate vital background on the Trojan War (Iphigenia’s story, Apollo’s punishment of the Greeks), those that appear later seem to only answer questions regarding specific words or phrases (origins of epithets and items, why a certain person or place is referenced). This would reflect different functions of these kinds of scholia, with the earlier part of the text relying on general backstory regarding the events of the story while those in the following sections are more geared towards explaining the potentially confusing aspects. It is interesting that, while the scholia at the beginning are focused on bringing the reader up to speed on events prior to the Iliad, the scholia at the end of Book XXIV do not discuss what will happen after the poem concludes.
