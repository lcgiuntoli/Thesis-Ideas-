Although ἱστορία/ἱστορέω scholia appear throughout the entirety of the Iliad, they are most heavily clustered together in Books I and II. This seems to make sense from a narrative level: the story begins in media res and the scribe must have thought some general backstory on the plot and characters would be helpful. However, these scholia less frequently as the story progresses, indicating either less of a need to elaborate on backstories or perhaps simple scribal fatigue. The scholia that do appear for the rest of the manuscript are generally geared towards explaining confusing epithets or phrases as well as recounting myths concerning specific people and places. This would reflect different functions of these scholia, with those that appear early on telling general backstory for the events of the story while those in the following sections are more geared towards explaining broadly confusing aspects of the text. Interestingly, while a great deal is made to give the reader insight on what events happened before the poem, there are no scholia at the end to describe what happens afterwards (i.e. the death of Achilles, the fall of Troy, etc.) This may indicate that while the scholarly tradition thought the beginning of the story was too confusing without elaboration in the notes, the ending of the poem was seen as a complete ending without lingering questions. Another possibility is that scholia describing events after the story do indeed occur in the manuscript, but were not part of our data because they do not include ἱστορία/ἱστορέω since these technically would not be backstories to the Iliad.
