It is interesting to note that some stories appear only in the scholia and not in the mythological handbooks of Apollodorus or Hyginus. Among these are Zeus' planning of the Trojan War, alternate names for Briseis, the binding of Zeus, names for the sons of Helen and Menelaus, and an episode recounting Achilles' sack of the city of Pedasus. One theory I may offer is that these many of these details are rather minute and may have seemed insignifcant for a general overview of myths. Often, these scholia are meant to explain details of the Iliad, a poem covering a section of just one period of the vast collection of Greek mythology.
